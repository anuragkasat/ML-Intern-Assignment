ML Intern Assignment

This repository contains a solution for the ML Intern Assignment, focusing on building a search and retrieval system for ClearFeed's documentation. The solution includes preprocessing, search retrieval using TF-IDF, and optional answer generation with embeddings.

Embedding-Based Answer Generation
Planned Feature
The solution was designed to include an embedding-based answer generation layer. This involves:

Retrieving the top 5 URLs and their content.
Generating answers using embeddings or an LLM like Google's Gemini API.
Current Status
Due to an issue with Gemini API credits, this feature is not fully implemented. Integration will resume once credits are available or an alternative embedding service is identified.
Embedding consisted using langchain and semantic analysis
also wanted to implement hybrid mode but still it depends on api credits
